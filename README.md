# CharityML
In this project we are going to create a machine learning model which predicts whether an individual earns more than $50k. We will then use these predicted values to send fliers to these indivduals in hopes of them donating to CharityML. The data I am using is from the 1994 US census.

This was the first of three projects to complete for Udacity's Machine Learning online course.

Check out my kaggle submission on https://www.kaggle.com/natkinson/competitions to see how I did.
